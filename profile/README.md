# Allsky Camera

This GitHub site contains the source code for the Allsky Camera project described [on Instructables](http://www.instructables.com/id/Wireless-All-Sky-Camera/).
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;   
> This site replaces the https://github.com/thomasjacquin/allsky site (which redirects you here).<br>Thomas' site was moved here to allow the rest of the Allsky team to more easily make changes.

&nbsp;   
This site includes several repositories:
*  **allsky** - the main Allsky code that takes images, saves them, creates timelapse, startrails, etc.<br>**We suggest bookmarking [the main allsky page](https://github.com/AllskyTeam/allsky) since you will rarely use the other repositories.**
*  **allsky-modules** - optional extra modules used by Allsky
*  **allsky-website** - (Allsky version v2023.05.01_05 or earlier only)  the code needed for a local (i.e., on the Pi) or remote Allsky Website.

&nbsp;
> See the [Allsky documentation](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AllskyTeam/allsky/master/html/documentation/index.html) for installation instructions.
